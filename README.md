### Description
This project is a platform assembling different open source techniques, built to provide data visualization user experience research, both from a qualitative and quantitative method. 

### Motivation
As researchers, we often find that visualizations are used in the analysis component of our process, when we have collected our data and need to begin to synthesize.

We see find there is a need for User Experience research to utilize visualizations earlier on in our process, where we need to better understand distribution of participants. This often exists in Sales or Marketing industry, but rarely does this get applied to Experience research. 

### Current Status
As of July 12th, 2019
 - [ ] Stand up Messaging Server
 - [ ] ScatterText Display
 - [ ] Hexbin Display
 - [ ] Sample Dataset(s)

### Contributions

 - We are in need of UI developers to build our front-end to a JS framework of your choosing.
 - We want feedback from Researchers and Data Scientists on the best way to position this platform to be both relevant and essential. 
 - Handling either single files or
